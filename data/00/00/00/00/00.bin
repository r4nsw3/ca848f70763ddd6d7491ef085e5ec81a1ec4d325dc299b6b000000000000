  |   environment ready to explore. Now the classic game has been           |

  |   A world where time has no meaning - and evil knows no bounds. Torn    |
  |   from a world long gone, the time traveling warrior Turok has found    |
  |   himself thrust into a savage land torn by conflict. An evil           |
  |   overlord known as 'The Campaigner' seeks to shred the fabric of       |
  |   time and rule the universe using an ancient artifact known as 'The    |
  |   Chronoscepter'. The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years    |
  |   ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The         |
  |   Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans    |
  |   to use to magnify and pervert the power of the Chronoscepter in       |
  |   order to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the           |
  |   universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the             |
  |   Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The   |
  |   Campaigner's evil plot...                                             |
  |                                                                         |
